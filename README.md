**Project Description**:
This repository contains the backend of an autonomous website designed to aggregate and present new games available on a weekly rotation (Sony,Epic, Amazon and Microsoft). 
The backend system is fully automated and scheduled, from initialization to displaying updated content on the website.

**Features**:
- **Web Scraping**: Visits four different online game stores to collect information about newly available free games.
- **YouTube Integration**: Automatically fetches relevant gameplay videos from YouTube and attaches them to the scraped game data.
- **Database Management**: Stores all collected data in a structured database for efficient processing, from which the website is populated. 

**Purpose**:
- This backend serves as the engine for the FreeBee website, ensuring it remains up-to-date with the latest games and their gameplay content.
- Providing users with a streamlined and engaging browsing experience.
- The Website itself can be found at the 'FreeBee' depository (Front end)
